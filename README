Well, the submodules idea didn't work... because I ain't gonna be
polluting my github with every little directory I track using git.
And so I combined them via local remotes... and track them as
individual branches being equivalent to repos; as in:

  aur        are some PKGBUILDs that I track from "AUR repo"
  aur-ypb    are my forks of the above
  community  like aur... you get the idea?

  ypb        are PKGBUILDs that originate purely locally, i.e.
             for some reason I wrote them from scratch

master branch being for not PKGBUILD files like AMI...
