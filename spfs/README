WHAT
----

This is spfs or rather ufs: old, single threaded version of 9P FS server for
*nix. There is also SVN repo of this and npfs - its later, improved, multi-
threaded version - hosted on sourceforge, but it will have to wait till "next
time"[tm] in order to get pacmaned... as npfs...

WHY
---

In order to have something "simple" to serve Arch packages from my desktop
inside LAN to the "edge" firewall. NFS seemed like an obvious first choice, but
it feels too clunky to keep restarting as it's not required to run all the time
and I don't feel too comfortable with RPC on the the firewall. Second choice of
sshfs doesn't feel right either as I do not want to keep private keys on the
firewall.

SPFS seems nice as it's only single, small executable needing one port to func-
tion and can be run as non-root user, though it exposes whole rootfs and I
haven't yet grokked how exactly identity is/should be handled. Anyway, as it is
it will refuse to start unless you set SPFS_USER in /etc/conf.d/spfs.conf and
change port (-p option) to something >1024 (e.g. 1128, twice its default port#),
better not try being cute by setting it to something like roo... Finally, on the
client side v9fs is handled by kernel module already present in the default Arch
config.
